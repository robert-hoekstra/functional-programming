# Picture my Heritage
This application is about putting everybody's personal heritage on screen by collecting all kinds of portret pictures taken around the world. These pictures are collected and digitalized by the Nationale Vereniging voor Wereldculturen.


## Getting Started
To start the application you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have done that. Open the `index.html` file with a web-browser. I advise to use Chrome. You can download Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/intl/nl/chrome/).

You can also open the app live at: [Github Pages](https://robert-hoekstra.github.io/functional-programming/)

### Want to run local?

Use the following commands or download as zip:
```
https://github.com/robert-hoekstra/functional-programming.git

open terminal

run: npm install
run: npm run

Go to localhost:#### whatever you set your host to.
```

## How to use the application
The app displays some options / filters that need to be selected in order to work properly.

**1. Choosing your Heritage**

You can choose your own heritage or a whole different heritage. The following option will now present itself. Including some pictures to start with!

**2. Choosing a timestamp**

You can now cycle through all the years to explore different collections of pictures that are taken within the selected year. Notice the difference in material and quality? What else can you explore?

Select a picture to learn more about it. And about it's statistics.

## How does the Application work (dev part)?

### Data
Data is imported trough a SparQL query that is connecten with an API to the national collection of the Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen.

#### Collectie Wereldculturen
The collection can be found [here](https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/). The collection contains every piece that can be found at the 4 musea that are part of the NMVW-group. Those are:

- TropenMuseum
- AfrikaMuseum
- WereldMuseum
- VolkenkundeMuseum

The collection can be used to browse and explore through the collection. But you can also see where the items are located and if they can be visited in real life.

##### Focus on Portrait pictures
There are a lot of pictures about all kinds of subjects in the collection. For this project I want to showcase all the faces behind a heritage. What face forms and displays a specific culture? In order to get to that part we'll move on to the next section: SparQL

###### SparQL
In order to 'talk' with and retrieve data from the collection we make use of a database written in a SparQl environment. This is cool because we can write and test queries in the environment. The query sends back results in a JSON format which we can use with D3.JavaScript!

My query looks like this:

```
# Prefixes define the predicates that are needed to search in the network of graphs within the database!
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX edm: <http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

# Select all results in the database
SELECT * 
# Define what the options are of what results I really want to retrieve.
WHERE {
# Retrieve all items that contain the word foto's or a word that is related to that word.
Foto's is declared by the termmaster: <https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster1397>
    
    
    <https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11840/termmaster1397> skos:narrower* ?type .
    ?type skos:prefLabel ?typeLabel.
    ?cho edm:object ?type.
   # ?cho dc:title ?title.
   # FILTER langMatches(lang(?title), "ned")

    # Does the word 'portret' (dutch for Portrait) display in the title or description of the result? If Yes: give me items. if No: reject item.
    ?cho (dc:title | dc:description) ?beschrijving.   
    FILTER(REGEX(?beschrijving, "portret"))  
  

    # Get extra details if they are available. If not, still show results.
    OPTIONAL {
        ?cho dc:title ?titel.
        ?cho dct:created ?date.
        ?cho foaf:depiction ?imgLink.

    }
}
```

### Browser-based
The application is run within a browser environment. The application is a prototype for something that could be a exhibition at the museum.

For this application a internetconnection is needed to retrieve ((dynamic)) data from the database.

## Who is the target audience?
Visitors of the musea in the Netherlands. I want to showcase something that can be found in the collection that is so broad that hopefully the visitors might visit the online collection or different exhibitionts/musea found in the NMVW group.
