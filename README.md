# Picture my Heritage
This application is about putting everybody's personal heritage on screen by collecting all kinds of portret pictures taken around the world. These pictures are collected and digitalized by the Nationale Vereniging voor Wereldculturen.

## Getting Started
To start the application you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have done that. Open the `index.html` file with a web-browser. I advise to use Chrome. You can download Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/intl/nl/chrome/).

## How to use the application
The app displays some options / filters that need to be selected in order to work properly.

**1. Choosing your Heritage**

You can choose your own heritage or a whole different heritage. The following option will now present itself. Including some pictures to start with!

**2. Choosing a timestamp**

You can now cycle through all the years to explore different collections of pictures that are taken within the selected year. Notice the difference in material and quality?

**3. Explore pictures**

Select a picture to learn more about it. And about it's statistics.
